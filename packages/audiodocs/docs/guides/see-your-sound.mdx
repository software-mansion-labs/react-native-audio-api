# See your sound

In this section, we explore the capabilities of the [`AnalyserNode`](/visualization/analyser-node) interface, focusing on techniques for extracting, processing, and visualizing audio data.
Our exploration will lead us to create simple audio visualizer app.

## Base application

Building on what we have learned in the previous tutorials, we will begin by developing a straightforward application designed to play sound from a file.
In addiction we will utilize `Canvas` from `react-native-skia` to visually represent our sound. To begin, simply copy and paste the code provided below into your project.

import Base from '@site/src/examples/SeeYourSound/BaseComponent';
import BaseSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/SeeYourSound/BaseSource';

<InteractiveExample component={Base} src={BaseSrc} />

## Create an analyzer to capture and process time-domain and frequency data in real-time

To obtain frequency and time-domain data, we need to utilize the [`AnalyserNode`](/visualization/analyser-node).
It is an [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node) that passes data unchanged from input to output while enabling the extraction of this data in two domains: time and frequency.
We will use two specific [`AnalyserNode's`](/visualization/analyser-node) methods: [`getByteTimeDomainData`](/visualization/analyser-node#getbytetimedomaindata) and [`getByteFrequencyData`](/visualization/analyser-node#getbytefrequencydata).
These methods will allow us to acquire the necessary data for our analysis.
