In this section, we will explore the use of the `AnalyserNode` interface.
We will delve into techniques for extracting, processing, and visualizing audio data, enabling a deeper understanding and more dynamic representation of sound.

## AnalyserNode

The AnalyserNode interface provides two core functionalities: extracting time-domain data and frequency-domain data from audio signals.

A time-domain graph illustrates how a signal evolves over time, displaying changes in amplitude or intensity as time progresses.
In contrast, a frequency-domain graph reveals how the signal's energy or power is distributed across different frequency bands, highlighting the presence and strength of various frequency components over a specified range.
