# TimeStretchType

`TimeStretchType` type specifies algorithm which will be used during time-stretching (changing speed of the playback) and pitch-shifting (changing pitch of the playback).

**Acceptable values:**
  - `'linear'`

  Uses naive linear approach while time-stretching and pitch-shifting the sound.

  - `'speech-music'`

  Uses sophisticated algorithm with pitch correction while time-stretching (`playbackRate`) and enables accurate pitch-shifting (`detune`).

:::caution

On `Web`, the value of `timeStretch` is permanently `'linear'`, and it cannot be set like on the `Android` or `iOS`.
