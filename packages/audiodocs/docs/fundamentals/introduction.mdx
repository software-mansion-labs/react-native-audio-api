# Introduction

React Native Audio API is an imperative, high-level API for processing and synthesizing audio in React Native Applications. React Native Audio API follows the [Web Audio Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio-1.1/) making it easier to write audio-heavy applications for iOS, Android and Web with just one codebase.


## Highlights

- Supports react-native, react-native-web or any web react based project
- API strictly follows the Web Audio API standard
- Blazingly fast, all of the Audio API core is written in C++ to deliver the best performance possible
- Truly native, we use most up-to-date native apis such as AVFoundation, CoreAudio or Oboe
- Modular routing architecture to fit simple (and complex) use-cases
- Sample-accurate scheduled sound playback with low-latency for musical applications requiring the highest degree of rhythmic precision.
- Efficient real-time time-domain and frequency-domain analysis / visualization
- Efficient biQuad filters for most common filtering methods.
- Support for computational audio synthesis

## Motivation

- follwing standard of web audio
- bringing tool built on top of web audio to react-native world


## How it works


## Alternatives

### Expo Audio
