# Getting started

The goal of _Fundamentals_ is to guide You through setup proces of Audio API as well as show base concepts standing behind audio programming using web audio framework to give you the confidence to explore more advanced use cases on your own. This section is packed with interactive examples, code snippets and explanations. Are you ready? Let's make some noise!

## What is React Native Audio API?

React Native Audio API is a powerful high-performant and low-level audio library built by [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).
RN Audio API is fully compatible\* with [Web Audio specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), making it easy to write audio-intensive applications for iOS, Android and Web with just one codebase.

## Installation

It takes only a few steps to add audio api to Your project:

### Install the package

Install `react-native-audio-api` package from npm:

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>

    npx expo install react-native-audio-api

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm install react-native-audio-api

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn add react-native-audio-api

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Expo development build

When using an [Expo development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/), run prebuild to update the native code in the `ios` and `android` directories.

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

### Platform specific setup

#### Android

No additional steps are necessary.

#### iOS

While developing for iOS, make sure to install [pods](https://cocoapods.org) first before running the app:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

#### Web

No additional steps are necessary.

:::caution

`react-native-audio-api` on web, exposes browser built-in Web Audio API, but for compatibility between platforms, its limits available interfaces to APIs that are implemented on iOS and Android.

:::

### Clear Metro bundler cache (recommended)

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>

    npx expo start -c

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm start -- --reset-cache

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn start --reset-cache

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
